## Priority Tasks

### 1. **~~Add User Attribution to Data~~** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Added Telegram user ID and username to database (tweets.scraped_by_user_id)
- ‚úÖ Included user attribution in JSON files (user_context field)
- ‚úÖ Track which user scraped each piece of content
- ‚úÖ Updated database schema with user tracking fields
- ‚úÖ Added user attribution to hashtags (who added which hashtag)
- ‚úÖ Created migration script for existing installations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite for user attribution functionality

### 2. **~~Implement Media Downloading & Self-Hosting~~** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive media download system using aiohttp
- ‚úÖ Implemented organized storage structure by platform and media type
- ‚úÖ Added public URL generation with domain integration
- ‚úÖ Created nginx configuration for optimal media serving
- ‚úÖ Fixed all file permissions for web server access
- ‚úÖ Added CORS headers and caching for performance
- ‚úÖ Enhanced database with download metadata tracking
- ‚úÖ Quality optimization for highest resolution downloads
- ‚úÖ Both original and self-hosted URLs in all outputs

### 3. **Make System Modular for Multi-Platform Support** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
- Refactor code to support multiple social media platforms
- Create platform-agnostic interfaces for:
  - Facebook posts
  - Instagram posts  
  - TikTok videos
  - Twitter/X tweets
- Organize code structure to easily add new platforms
- Create common data models and storage patterns

## Media Self-Hosting Implementation Details
### Features Completed:
- **Automatic Download**: All media files downloaded during tweet processing
- **Quality Optimization**: Downloads highest quality available (original resolution for images, highest bitrate for videos)
- **Organized Storage**: Files stored in `scraped_data/media/{type}/twitter/` structure
- **Public URLs**: Generated with format `https://ov-ab103a.infomaniak.ch/data/media/{type}/twitter/{filename}`
- **Web Serving**: Nginx configured with CORS, caching, and security headers
- **Database Integration**: Download status, file sizes, paths tracked in database
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with status tracking

### JSON Output Format:
```json
{
  "media": [
    {
      "url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/example.jpg",
      "hosted_url": "https://ov-ab103a.infomaniak.ch/data/media/images/twitter/filename.jpg",
      "local_path": "/home/ubuntu/.../scraped_data/media/images/twitter/filename.jpg",
      "file_size": 1234567,
      "type": "photo",
      "mime_type": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Ongoing Issues to Monitor
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Video media extraction occasionally fails due to Twitter API restrictions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tweets fail to scrape due to rate limiting (but error handling is good)
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Media files now permanently archived and accessible

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: ~~User Attribution~~ ‚úÖ & ~~Media Self-Hosting~~ ‚úÖ & Modularity
