# TODO - Twitter Scraper Project

## Current Status (Working Features)
- ✅ Hashtag extraction from scraped tweets (working well)
- ✅ Photo media extraction and logging (working reliably)
- ✅ PostgreSQL database integration with full-text search
- ✅ User hashtag support in database schema
- ✅ Telegram bot webhook integration
- ✅ Tweet caching to avoid re-scraping
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Environment configuration for production deployment

## Issues to Fix
- ❌ Video media extraction is unreliable (sometimes fails due to tweet restrictions)
- ❌ Cached data sometimes missing hashtags/media in responses
- ❌ Some tweets fail to scrape due to Twitter API access restrictions/rate limiting
- ❌ Complex media object handling needs improvement (photos/videos/gifs arrays)
- ❌ Video download links not properly added to bot responses

## Next Steps
1. **Improve video extraction reliability**
   - Better error handling for restricted tweets
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for video access
   - Test with various video tweet types

2. **Enhance media response formatting**
   - Add proper icons for different media types
   - Implement video download links in bot responses
   - Better handling of animated GIFs

3. **Cache management improvements**
   - Implement cache invalidation strategy
   - Add cache refresh mechanisms
   - Better handling of stale cached data

4. **Error handling and resilience**
   - Better handling of API rate limits
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - More graceful degradation when features fail

5. **Testing and validation**
   - Test with various tweet types (photos, videos, threads)
   - Validate hashtag extraction across different tweet formats
   - Performance testing with high-volume scraping

## Notes
- The system is production-ready for basic tweet scraping with photos and hashtags
- Video extraction needs significant work before being reliable
- Database schema supports all planned features
- Bot infrastructure is solid and scalable
