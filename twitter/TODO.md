# TODO - Social Media Archive Project

## Recently Completed (Latest Updates)
- ‚úÖ **Implemented User Attribution System** - Complete user tracking for all scraped content
  - Added Telegram user ID and username tracking to database
  - Updated JSON files to include user context information
  - Added user attribution to hashtags (who added which hashtag)
  - Created migration script for existing databases
  - Added comprehensive test suite for user attribution
- ‚úÖ **Fixed hashtag inclusion in JSON files** - Hashtags now saved to both database and JSON
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Python bytecode caching issues** - Implemented proper cache clearing workflow
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced storage_utils.py** - Now properly handles both user_hashtags and scraped_hashtags
- ‚úÖ **Fixed syntax errors in scrape_tweet.py** - Resolved f-string and code structure issues
- ‚úÖ **Verified database integration** - Confirmed hashtags and media saving correctly to PostgreSQL

## Current Status (Working Features)
- ‚úÖ **Complete User Attribution System** - Track which Telegram user scraped each tweet
- ‚úÖ Hashtag extraction from scraped tweets (working perfectly)
- ‚úÖ Photo and video media extraction (improved reliability)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database integration with full-text search
- ‚úÖ User hashtag support in both database and JSON files
- ‚úÖ Telegram bot webhook integration
- ‚úÖ Tweet caching with proper fresh scraping
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration for production deployment
- ‚úÖ Enhanced storage manager with dual JSON/database saving

## Priority Tasks

### 1. **~~Add User Attribution to Data~~** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Added Telegram user ID and username to database (tweets.scraped_by_user_id)
- ‚úÖ Included user attribution in JSON files (user_context field)
- ‚úÖ Track which user scraped each piece of content
- ‚úÖ Updated database schema with user tracking fields
- ‚úÖ Added user attribution to hashtags (who added which hashtag)
- ‚úÖ Created migration script for existing installations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite for user attribution functionality

### 2. **Make System Modular for Multi-Platform Support** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
- Refactor code to support multiple social media platforms
- Create platform-agnostic interfaces for:
  - Facebook posts
  - Instagram posts  
  - TikTok videos
  - Twitter/X tweets
- Organize code structure to easily add new platforms
- Create common data models and storage patterns

## Ongoing Issues to Monitor
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Video media extraction occasionally fails due to Twitter API restrictions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tweets fail to scrape due to rate limiting (but error handling is good)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex media handling could be further optimized

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: ~~User Attribution~~ & Modularity
1. **~~User tracking implementation~~** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - ‚úÖ Added user_id field to database tables
   - ‚úÖ Include user context in all scraping operations
   - ‚úÖ Updated bot to pass user information to storage layer

2. **Platform modularity refactoring**
   - Create base classes for social media scrapers
   - Standardize data models across platforms
   - Implement plugin architecture for new platforms

### Phase 2: Multi-Platform Support
1. **Facebook integration**
   - Implement Facebook post scraping
   - Handle Facebook media types
   - Create Facebook-specific bot commands

2. **Instagram integration**
   - Implement Instagram post/story scraping
   - Handle Instagram media formats
   - Create Instagram-specific workflows

3. **TikTok integration**
   - Implement TikTok video scraping
   - Handle TikTok-specific metadata
   - Create TikTok-specific bot interactions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Enhanced search and filtering**
2. **Bulk import/export capabilities**
3. **Advanced analytics and reporting**
4. **API for external integrations**

## Technical Architecture Goals
- **Modular design**: Easy to add new platforms
- **Consistent interfaces**: Same bot commands work across platforms
- **Unified storage**: Common database schema for all platforms
- **Scalable infrastructure**: Support for high-volume usage
- **Maintainable code**: Clear separation of concerns

## Notes
- Current Twitter implementation is stable and production-ready
- Foundation is solid for expanding to other platforms
- Database schema designed to accommodate multi-platform data
- Bot infrastructure can easily support additional commands and platforms
